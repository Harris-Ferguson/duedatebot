Create new Due-Dates, sort them by Course, and display what files to hand in! 

## Contributing: 
### Dependancies:
You will need to install the following packages via pip:
 - discord
 - pymongo
 - dotenv
 
 There are loads of way to contribute to this project at this stage! If you want to help with the functionality of the bot, create your own bot on the discord developer portal, and create a cluster on MongoDB (or if your from the CMPT Discord DM duckypotato for his testing one). Clone this repository, then create a .env file in the directory with the two keys (make sure the name of the ENV variables matches whats in bot.py) 

We also need people for a few other thing:
 - Writing Documentation (ESPECIALLY doctstrings)
 - Screenshots of commands in action (so we can put them on this page!)
 - Writing better help messages
 - Writing more interesting reply messaages
 - Coming up with ideas for commands 
 - Adding command Aliases
 
Check out Issues for stuff you can help out with!
