## Contributing: 
### Dependancies:
You will need to install the following packages via pip:
 - discord
 - pymongo
 - dotenv
 
 ### Setting up the Environment
 After making sure you have the proper python packages, clone the repo. In the same directory as the codebase, create a file called .env, with the following content:
 ```
 # .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=<Your discord bot token>
DB_PASS=<Your mongodb token>
 ```
For developing, you should create your own discord bot and test server to run it in. 
create your own cluster with MongoDB as well for testing.
